qmd.multiblock_validation.beam_director.must_be_cube=The Beam Diverter must be 1 5x5 Cube with a dipole in the centre.
qmd.multiblock_validation.beam_director.must_be_beam=There must have a Accelerator Beam Block at the centre.
qmd.multiblock_validation.accelerator.beam_director.must_be_dipole=There Must be a vertical or horizontal dipole at the centre.

qmd.particle.pion_plus.desc=Pions are the particles that are responsible for holding nuclei together. Although not coloured themselves they distribute the "residual" strong force to keep nuclei together.
qmd.particle.pion_naught.desc=Pions are the particles that are responsible for holding nuclei together. Although not coloured themselves they distribute the "residual" strong force to keep nuclei together.
qmd.particle.pion_minus.desc=Pions are the particles that are responsible for holding nuclei together. Although not coloured themselves they distribute the "residual" strong force to keep nuclei together.


qmd.particle.eta.desc=Eta Mesons are flavourless mesons meaning their flavour numbers like strangeness and isospin are 0.
qmd.particle.eta_prime.desc=Eta Mesons are flavourless mesons meaning their flavour numbers like strangeness and isospin are 0.
qmd.particle.charmed_eta.desc=Eta Mesons are flavourless mesons meaning their flavour numbers like strangeness and isospin are 0.
qmd.particle.bottom_eta.desc=Eta Mesons are flavourless mesons meaning their flavour numbers like strangeness and isospin are 0.
