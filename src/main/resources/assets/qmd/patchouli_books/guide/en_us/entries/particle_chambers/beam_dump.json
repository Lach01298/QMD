			"text": "They are constructed the same as $(l:particle_chambers/target_chamber)Target Chambers$(/l) but since detectors don't do anything in them there is little point in making them any bigger than a 3x3x3. They require one Particle Chamber Beam Port in input mode and a Particle Chamber Fluid Port in output mode."

			"text": "Beam dumps simply work by piping in particles and supplying power. The recipes can be seen in JEI. Where the amount is the is the total pu supplied to finish the recipe i.e at 100 pu/t a 600 pu recipe will take 6 ticks to complete. The energy and focus in the recipe are both the minimum required. Normally for recipes this is 0 for both. If there is a maximum energy the recipe will say."
