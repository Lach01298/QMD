Nuclearcraft adds more units like $(l)heat$(): H or $(l)Rads per tick$(): Rad/t and so does QMD.$(br2)An important thing to know is units can have prefixes. We have already one $(l)milli$() : m in millibuckets. Prefixes are the symbol that comes before the unit that tells you how to scale the unit."

Each SI prefix is a certain power of 10. $(br)For example milli is 10^-3 = 0.001, this is a thousandth, so there is 10^3 = 1000 mB 'millibuckets' in a B 'bucket'.$(br2)Here is a list of all the SI Prefixes."
