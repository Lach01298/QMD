Focus's main purpose is to tell you how far the beam of particles can travel. If a particle stack's focus is less than or equal to zero then it can't propagate. Each block the particles travel they lose focus. Focus also has use in some recipes."

But in recipes like the $(l:multiblocks/particle_chambers/target_chamber)Target Chamber$(/l), and $(l:multiblocks/vacuum_chambers/exotic_containment_chamber)Exotic Containment Chamber$(/l) it is the cumulative amount needed to complete the recipe."

It can only be done with clever manipulation of particles in $(l:multiblocks/particle_chambers/target_chamber)target chambers$(/l) and/or $(l:multiblocks/particle_chambers/decay_chamber)decay chambers$(/l) to create effective particle multiplier setups."
