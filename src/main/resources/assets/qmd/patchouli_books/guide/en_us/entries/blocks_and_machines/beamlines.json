The can only go in straight lines and have attenuation loss so particles that go through them lose focus every block traveled. You can see information about a particle beam like the the focus loss by right clicking on a beamline with the $(l:items_and_devices/beam_meter)beam meter$(/l). For information on how focus loss is calculated look in $(l:particles/introduction#focus_loss)General Information on particles$(/l)."
