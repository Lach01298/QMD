These ion source items can be found in JEI by looking at the Accelerator Ion Source block's uses. These items can be piped in and out of the ion source either directly or through an Accelerator Item Port. It also has a gui for manual access."

If a redstone strength of 15 (max) is applied to the controller it will output the maximum energy anything less than 15 it will output the corresponding fraction of the maximum energy for example a redstone strength of 2 is 2/15= 13.3% of the max energy."
