This, like N-type doped silicon is used as an essential crafting ingredient in QMD. $(br2)Your setup will consist of one $(l:multiblocks/accelerators/linear_accelerator)linear accelerator$(/l) with an $(l:multiblocks/accelerators/linear_accelerator#ion_source)ion source$(/l) using diborane canisters. This accelerator needs to accelerate $(l:particles/list#boron_ion)boron ions$(/l) to at least 600 keV and they must have a minimum focus of 2."
