			"title": "Operation",
			"type": "text",
			"text": "A decelerator functions the same as a  $(l:multiblocks/accelerators/ring_accelerator#operation)synchrotron$(/l). The difference between a synchrotron is the maximum particle energy that can be inputted $(l)Eᵩ=(qB₂R)²/(2m)$() same as a $(l:multiblocks/accelerators/ring_accelerator#max_dipole)synchrotrons$(/l) form max dipole strength"

		{
			"type": "text",
			"text": "The energy of the output particles is determined by the strength of the redstone signal applied to the controller. A full 15 strength will decelerate down to ~ 0 i.e less than 1 keV. This is required for creating neutral antimatter. For any redstone strength, the energy the decelerator will try to put the particles at is E=Eᵩ(1-Sᵣ/15) where Sᵣ is the redstone signal strength."

			"text": "For example if we have a decelerator with a max input energy of 2 GeV and we apply a redstone signal of 8, then 2 GeV*(1-8/15)=933.33 MeV. $(br2)$(bold)Note:$() If the inputted particle energy is lower than this targeted energy it will leave the energy unchanged (i.e. it does not increase particle energy)."
