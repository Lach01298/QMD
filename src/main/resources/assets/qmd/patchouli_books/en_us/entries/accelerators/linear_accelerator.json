			"text": "Linear Accelerators are a cuboid of Accelerator Casings or Glass that must be 5 wide and tall. Like all $(l:accelerators/general)accelerators$(/l) they require coolant vent in input and output modes and an energy port. There must be a continuous line of Accelerator Beams down the centre. Where the beams meet the casing there must be an Accelerator Ion source (or Accelerator Beam Port in input mode for using an existing beam) at one end and an Accelerator Beam Port at the other."

			"text": "Linear Accelerators are the start of any accelerator system. They are used to create new particle beams with an ion source. The ion souce must be supplied with a source item to create the particles canister of hydrogen. The item will be used up after a certain amount of time (default 300 seconds) while the accelerator is running so it must be continually replaced for the accelerator to continue functioning."
