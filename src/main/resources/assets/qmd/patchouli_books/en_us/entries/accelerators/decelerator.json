			"title": "Particle Energy",
			"type": "text",
			"text": "A decelerator functions the same as any other $(l:accelerators/general)accelerator$(/l) requiring power and coolant. It requires an existing particle beam to be pipe in. The maximum energy a particle can be piped in is the same as the synchrotron's max particle energy from the dipole strength $(l:accelerators/ring_accelerator#max_dipole)Eₓ=1000(qB₂R)²/(2m)$(/l)."

		{
			"type": "text",
			"text": "The energy of the output particles is determined by the strength of the redstone signal applied to the controller. A full 15 strength will decelerate down to ~ 0 i.e less than 1 keV. This is required for creating neutral antimatter. For any redstone strength, the energy the decelerator will try to put the particles at is E=Eₓ(1-Sᵣ/15) where Sᵣ is the redstone signal strength."
